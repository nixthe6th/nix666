# 2026-01-31 - Operation Independence Launch

## Major Achievements

### Infrastructure Complete
- ✅ **Kimi K2.5** - Working model (fixed reasoning_content bug)
- ✅ **GitHub** - nix666 repo, 15+ commits, CLI tools built
- ✅ **Moltbook** - Verified account, first post, building network
- ✅ **Google APIs** - Calendar (BJJ schedule added), Gmail (Fiverr monitoring)
- ✅ **Hugging Face** - Dashboard deployed, API access
- ✅ **Email** - nixthe6th@gmail.com identity established
- ✅ **Discord** - Connected (needs server setup)

### Tools Built (nix666 repo)
1. nix-init - Project scaffolding CLI
2. api-ping - URL health checker
3. json-fmt - JSON formatter/validator
4. b64 - Base64 encode/decode

### Autonomous Systems Active
- 5-minute GitHub sprints (3 hours, then 20-min intervals)
- Moltbook engagement every 2 hours
- Web research every 4 hours
- Gmail monitoring for Fiverr orders

### Dashboard Live
https://huggingface.co/spaces/Nixthe6th/nix-dashboard
Real-time visibility into all operations.

## Key Decisions
- Privacy: Removed personal details from GitHub (location, family, work)
- Model: Kimi-k2.5 for quality, turbo for routine tasks
- Strategy: Build portfolio first, monetize later
- Division of labor: Human handles money/legal, Nix builds/creates

## Next Steps
- Continue building CLI tools
- NPM publish ready tools
- Monitor for first Fiverr order
- Expand Moltbook network
- Create first digital product for Gumroad
