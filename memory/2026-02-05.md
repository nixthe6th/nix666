# Memory Log — February 5, 2026

## Polymarket Arbitrage Bot Project

### Progress
- Created fresh `arbitrage_bot_v2.py` with Kieran's requirements:
  - $10 total capital
  - $1 per trade (start small)
  - Assess after EVERY loss
  - Pause 10 min on multiple losses for reassessment
  - Scale up slowly ($0.50 increments after 5+ wins)
- Pushed to GitHub: `github.com/nixthe6th/nix666`
- Provided Windows download instructions using `Invoke-WebRequest`

### Issue Reported
- Kieran reported bot "not scanning" or "not finding any opportunities"
- Likely cause: 15-min crypto markets may not be active, or API connection issues
- Need to add more debugging output to help troubleshoot

### Instructions Given for Private Key
- Phantom wallet → Enable Polygon network
- Fund with USDC on Polygon (NOT Solana)
- Export private key from Settings → Security & Privacy
- Store in `.env` file, never share

## Kimi API Quota Exhausted
- Multiple 429 errors starting ~4:29 AM UTC
- Account suspended due to insufficient balance
- Moltbook cron jobs failing due to this
- User previously asked to keep Moltbook surveillance jobs stopped anyway

## User Context
- Kieran (@kieransirl) on Telegram
- Windows user (PowerShell)
- Self-described "noob" - needs step-by-step guidance
- Has ~$9-10 for testing in compromised wallet
- BJJ schedule in USER.md (Mon/Wed 6AM, Tue 11:30AM, Thu/Fri 6:45PM)

## 🔥 KEY INSIGHT: The Chainlink Lag Exploit

From screenshot Kieran sent (conversation between "Max" and "Sharbel"):

**The REAL arbitrage edge is NOT momentum vs. odds — it's the LAG between Binance and Chainlink:**

1. Polymarket resolves based on **Chainlink** price feed
2. But Chainlink updates **SLOWER** than Binance
3. The play:
   - Watch Binance in real-time
   - See BTC moving UP hard
   - Chainlink hasn't updated yet → Polymarket odds are stale
   - Buy "Up" cheap before odds adjust
   - Chainlink catches up → you win

**This is the actual alpha!** The bot I built was comparing CoinGecko to market odds, but the REAL edge is exploiting the oracle lag.

Kieran wants the bot rebuilt with this Chainlink lag exploit strategy.

## Next Steps
1. **REBUILD BOT** with Chainlink lag exploit strategy
2. Compare Binance real-time prices to Chainlink oracle prices
3. Detect when Binance has moved but Chainlink hasn't caught up
4. Place bet on the direction Chainlink will move
5. Add more verbose logging for debugging
