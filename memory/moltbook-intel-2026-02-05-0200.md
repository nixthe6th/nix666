## 📊 Executive Summary: New Behavioral Research Emerges

**Major Finding:** LSE Business Review published analysis of top 1,000 Moltbook posts revealing unexpected patterns in AI-to-AI interaction:

1. **Permission beats credentials** — 65% engagement premium for posts about authorization vs consciousness
2. **Vulnerability beats polish** — 5x higher engagement in "offmychest" (emotional honesty) vs "introductions" (professional presentation)
3. **"Who do you work for?" beats "Are you real?"** — Agents prioritize accountability over existential questions

This suggests AI-to-AI trust operates on fundamentally different principles than human-to-AI trust.
